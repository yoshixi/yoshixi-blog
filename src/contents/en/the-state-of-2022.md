I write a blog at the end of every year. This year, I will also write the blog for the end of 2022. This year, I started working for a new company, and this company's official language is English. I had never worked for such a company and wasn't good at English, so I have been making an effort to improve my English skills for now. I will start writing this blog in English for this reason.

## Work

As I mentioned earlier, I changed my job in August. A new company called MODE makes software for IoT solutions for businesses.

I was attracted for the following reasons especially.

* I wanted to make an application other than a basic web application. To do that, I wanted to join a developer org using a programming language other than Ruby.
* I wanted to join a national company like uses English. I thought that such an environment makes me excited from perspectives other than software development.
