I write a blog at the end of every year. This year, I will also write the blog for the end of 2022. This year, I started working for a new company, and this company's official language is English. I had never worked for such a company and wasn't good at English, so I have been making an effort to improve my English skills for now. I will start writing this blog in English for this reason.

## Work

As I mentioned earlier, I changed my job in August. A new company called MODE makes software for IoT solutions for businesses.

I was attracted for the following reasons especially.

* I wanted to make an application other than a basic web application. To do that, I wanted to join a developer org using a programming language other than Ruby.
* I wanted to join a national company like uses English. I thought that such an environment would make me excited from perspectives other than software development.
* I wanted to join an organization having experienced people than me. My previous company's organization is young, and this is my first company. So I had no experience working with a senior person. I wanted to belong to an organization having senior members once.

Having joined and been working for five months, the work and environment are as expected. I'm enjoying the MODE life.

For the next year, I will gain deep knowledge of the company's software itself and low-level programming like a Linux system. My first company used Docker, and I had fewer experiences with touching the Linux system directly. In terms of IoT solutions, it needs to consider an edge-side computer and need to consider Linux system. These are good opportunities for me to learn Linux systems. Making IoT software solutions, unlike making basic web applications, has many consideration points, and it sometimes makes me a hard time but also gives me a lot of knowledge about systems.
