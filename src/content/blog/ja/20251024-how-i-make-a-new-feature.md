# How I make a new feature

I have been desiging a new feature, including building a new micro service, enhance exiting feature adding a new concept, and etc..., in my curent company for over 1 year as a tech lead of a team.
Everytime when I start to write a proposal, I was a bit annoyed since I don't have a framework in my mind. It was a like a building a idea from scrach and I was waiting for god giving me an idea. :).
But, finally, I got a words that explains how I has been doing.




A yanger engineer tends to start thinking from existing resources, and constraints, then build a feature, like I was yung.
